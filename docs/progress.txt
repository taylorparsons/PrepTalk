Session: 2026-01-28 00:00
Goal: Snapshot repo status from docs/plans and align next work.

DONE
- [2026-01-28 00:00] Create `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/progress.txt` to start RALPH tracking.
- [2026-01-28 00:00] Review `docs/plans/*` and map plans to implementation (most items already shipped; see notes).

IN PROGRESS
- Validate and update Live audio model defaults (see `docs/plans/2026-01-16-gemini-live-audio-model-options.md`).

NEXT
- Run manual voice smoke test checklist in `docs/testing/voice-smoke-test.md` and record results.
- Fill hackathon deliverables in `README.md` (demo link, write-up, 3-minute video).
- Decide whether the LiveKit voice coach POC belongs in this repo (see `docs/plans/2026-01-14-livekit-voice-coach-plan.md`).
- Optional hygiene: add `.codex/` to `.gitignore` if it should not be tracked (called out in `docs/plans/2026-01-10-gemini-live-design.md`).

NOTES
- Commands run: `ls`, `find`, `rg`, `sed` (status review only)
- Decisions: N/A
- Findings:
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-10-gemini-live-design.md`: core backend/frontend checklist is complete; manual voice smoke test + hackathon deliverables remain unchecked.
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-12-session-resume-plan.md`: all action items are checked and appear implemented.
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-13-live-log-dashboard.md` + `docs/plans/2026-01-13-log-analysis-design.md`: log parsing/metrics, `/api/logs/summary`, `/api/telemetry`, and the Live Stats panel are implemented with tests.
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-19-p0-audio-playback.md` + `docs/plans/2026-01-19-turn-mode-audio-playback.md`: turn-mode defaults + browser TTS path are implemented with tests; still worth verifying via the manual Chrome smoke test.
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-14-livekit-voice-coach-plan.md`: research plan only (no LiveKit code in `app/`).
  - `docs/plans/2026-01-16-gemini-live-audio-model-options.md`: still pending.
- Risks / open questions: Some plan docs are design-only and not tracked as a backlog; pick one next deliverable and timebox it.
